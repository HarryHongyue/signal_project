## Alarm Generation System Design Principles

The Alert Generation System is designed to monitor a patient's vital signs, detect abnormalities based on personalized thresholds, and notify the relevant medical staff. The design uses a modular approach to clearly differentiate between different concerns.

The system consists of several key components: AlertGenerator evaluates incoming patient data based on predefined thresholds; Threshold defines the rules that make up an abnormal reading; Alert represents the notification event; AlertManager handles the routing and distribution of alerts; and MedicalStaff represents the healthcare staff; PatientVitalData encapsulates the patient's measurement data; AlertNotifier manages the actual delivery of the notification.

This architecture has several advantages. Firstly, it allows for personalized monitoring by maintaining patient-specific thresholds. Secondly, it supports scalability by separating alert management (AlertManager) from notification delivery (AlertNotifier). Thirdly, it also uses different notification strategies through the AlertNotifier class, a class that can utilize different communication channels to ensure more efficient communication.

The clear distinction between components makes the system easier to maintain and test, as each class has clear responsibilities. The design now balances simplicity with the flexibility required in a critical medical monitoring environment.
