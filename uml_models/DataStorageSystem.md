## Data Storage System Design Principles

The Data Storage System is designed to provide a secure, efficient, and flexible solution for managing patient healthcare data. The system not only supports basic data storage and retrieval functions, but also implements important security and compliance features.

The core components include DataStorage to manage the overall data, Patient class to record individual patient data and its record collections, and PatientRecord to represent specific medical information at a single point in time. This hierarchical structure allows the system to efficiently organize and retrieve patient-specific data for specific time periods.

The system implements multiple security measures: AccessControlManager ensures that only authorized personnel can access patient data, supporting the setting of different rights management; DataRetentionPolicy automatically enforces data retention and deletion policies, thus enabling and optimizing the use of storage; AuditLogger records all data access and modification operations and supports a complete audit trail, which is critical for privacy protection and compliance in healthcare systems.

DataRetriever serves as the front-end interface, providing a secure and unified way to access patient data, validating permissions prior to each data access and supporting a variety of data retrieval modes, including time-range queries and statistical analysis.

This design achieves separation of concerns and enhances system maintainability and scalability, while safeguarding the security and privacy of patient data.
